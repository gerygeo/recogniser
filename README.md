Digit Recogniser
The goal of this project is to built a model based on the MNIST data to recognise digits from pictures.
The model achives 0.9890 accuracy on the test data provided in Kaggle.
It can be run as: python recogniser.py
It outputs a file with the Image ID and it's label, i.e. the predicted digit.
